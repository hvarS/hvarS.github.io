I am currently involved in research as a research developer at <a href='https://github.com/dair-iitd'>DAIR, IIT Delhi</a> on Conversational Recommendation Systems with Knowledge Base at its backend and am being advised by [Prof. Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/index.html) and [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/). My research interests include but are not limited to graphical applications in computational conversational and NLP applications in social systems in general.

In the past, I have been involved in research activities with [Prof. Aruna Tiwari](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/) on graphical ML techniques and [Prof. Tanmay Basu](https://sites.google.com/view/tanmaybasu/) on knowledge mining in medical texts. Once upon a time, I had the pleasure to work with [Prof. Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/) and [Prof. Vikram Srinivasan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/vikram-srinivasan/) on understanding and characterising latency versus redundancy trade-offs in distributed systems.

Previously, I also used to serve as a Backend Server Technology developer at Oracle Cloud Applications. At [Oracle](https://oracle.com) , I developed efficient and robust solutions and automations for data pipeline in HCM and CX modules.
