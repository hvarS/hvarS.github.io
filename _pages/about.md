I am currently a second-year graduate student in the Computer Science department, I am at the forefront of cutting-edge research in machine learning and natural language processing. My work as a machine learning engineer at <a href='https://www.articulateai.com/'>articulate.ai</a>, collaborating closely with <a href='https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/'>Prof. Zhou Yu</a>, has provided me with invaluable industry experience in developing innovative AI solutions.

Currently, I am also engaged in groundbreaking research with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_McKeown'>Prof. Kathleen McKeown</a>, focusing on generative applications for Large Language Models (LLMs) and style embedding in generative foundational models. This work is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language generation and understanding.

My academic journey has been marked by a diverse range of research experiences. I've explored graphical applications in computational conversational systems with [Prof. Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/index.html) and [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/) and NLP applications in social systems. My previous work includes collaborations with esteemed researchers on topics such as graphical ML techniques with with [Prof. Aruna Tiwari](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/), knowledge mining in medical texts with [Prof. Tanmay Basu](https://sites.google.com/view/tanmaybasu/) on knowledge mining in medical texts, and latency versus redundancy trade-offs in distributed systems with [Prof. Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/).

Prior to my graduate studies, I honed my technical skills as a Backend Server Technology developer at [Oracle](https://oracle.com) Cloud Applications, where I developed efficient and robust solutions for data pipelines in HCM and CX modules.

I am currently involved in research as a research developer at <a href='https://github.com/dair-iitd'>DAIR, IIT Delhi</a> on Conversational Recommendation Systems with Knowledge Base at its backend and am being advised by [Prof. Mausam](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/index.html) and [Prof. Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/). My research interests include but are not limited to graphical applications in computational conversational and NLP applications in social systems in general.



In the past, I have been involved in research activities with [Prof. Aruna Tiwari](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/) on graphical ML techniques and [Prof. Tanmay Basu](https://sites.google.com/view/tanmaybasu/) on knowledge mining in medical texts. Once upon a time, I had the pleasure to work with [Prof. Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/) and [Prof. Vikram Srinivasan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/vikram-srinivasan/) on understanding and characterising latency versus redundancy trade-offs in distributed systems.

Previously, I also used to serve as a Backend Server Technology developer at Oracle Cloud Applications. At [Oracle](https://oracle.com) , I developed efficient and robust solutions and automations for data pipeline in HCM and CX modules.
